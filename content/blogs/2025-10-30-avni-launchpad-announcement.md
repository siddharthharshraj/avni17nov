#### Announcing the Avni Launchpad Cohort 1

Many NGOs running field-based programs are still on cumbersome paper/spreadsheet-based or expensive systems. Avni solves this problem by providing a low-code, AI-powered digital platform that helps organisations create offline-capable fieldwork applications and get real-time insights. </br> NGOs want to switch to Avni, but sometimes they struggle to take the leap or fail to convince the decision makers of its value. To ease this process, we are launching a very quick and inexpensive way to **<span style="color:#ff470f">see the value of using Avni before investing further</span>**. 

The Avni Launchpad is a unique cohort-based program tailored for NGOs and social enterprises ready to take their first big step in digital transformation. In a short time of a few weeks, selected organizations receive hands-on mentoring, tailored support, and free access to Avni’s robust platform to launch a real, working digital pilot that elevates program monitoring, field data, and reporting.

### Why Join the program?

If you’re an NGO working in the field, this program helps you explore how digital tools can make your work easier and more effective.

**1. Learn to go digital**</br>
Discover how to use Avni, a mobile app that helps you collect and manage data — even without internet.

**2. Save time and reduce errors**</br>
Move from paper-based data collection to a simple digital system that’s faster, more reliable, and easy to manage.

**3. Test before investing**</br>
Experience the value of going digital through a guided pilot, before committing major time or funds. We are offering free hosting and support until the end of launchpad program and a 10% discount on annual subscription if you sign up before the program ends. 

**4. Get hands-on support and build capacity**</br>
Work with mentors, peers, and our team to turn your idea into a working pilot ready for the field.

**5. Access to Avni community**</br>
Join the Avni community - network with vibrant group of change-makers

**<span style="color:#ff470f">Overall this is savings of 1 Lakh Rupees or more !</span>**
