September was a month full of exciting updates! From smarter assistance to faster app building, here’s everything we worked on to make your Avni experience better.


### 🤖 AI Assistant (Beta)
You can now ask questions directly to the AI Assistant to clear your doubts. It can also guide you in building your own Avni app. This feature is in Beta, and we’re actively working on making it smarter and more helpful.

### ⚡ Build Your App Without Waiting
Earlier, you had to fill out a form on the Avni website and wait for our team to create your organisation before you could begin setting up your app. With this update, you can start creating your app right away after submitting the form.

### 🖼️ Filter by Multiple Fields in Media Viewer
Previously, you could only filter images by one field at a time. Now, you can apply multiple filters simultaneously for easier browsing and analysis.
