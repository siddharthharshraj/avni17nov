# How Goonj Uses Avni To Digitise Offline Data Collection And Inventory Flow

## The Challenge

Goonj's work is guided by the principle of dignity over charity. Material is never simply given away; it is received as recognition of a community's effort in addressing its own needs. This philosophy influences how they approach data collection and inventory management.

Operating across multiple states with thousands of volunteers, Goonj faced significant challenges:

- **Manual inventory tracking** across 20+ collection centers
- **Offline data collection** in remote areas with no internet connectivity
- **Complex material flow** from urban collection to rural distribution
- **Limited visibility** into real-time inventory status
